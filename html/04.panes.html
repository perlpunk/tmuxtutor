<p>Working with panes</p>

<p>Windows are nice, but often you want to see several windows at the same time; for viewing log files, showing the output of your test suite, manage your git commits etc.</p>

<p>For that, tmux has panes inside of windows.</p>

<p>Splitting a window into two panes is easy. To split vertically, type</p>

<pre><code>  PREFIX + %
</code></pre>

<p>To split horizontally, use</p>

<pre><code>  PREFIX + &quot; (double quote)
</code></pre>

<p>So now create a new pane by <code>PREFIX + %</code>. The new pane is automatically focused.</p>

<p>To navigate, you can use the arrow keys. So to go back to this pane, type</p>

<pre><code>  PREFIX + Left
</code></pre>

<p>To quickly navigate between two panes, use</p>

<pre><code>  PREFIX + ;
</code></pre>

<p>Remember:</p>

<pre><code>  Last window: PREFIX + l
  Last pane:   PREFIX + ;
</code></pre>

<p>To go to the next pane, type</p>

<pre><code>  PREFIX + o
</code></pre>

<p>Remember you can always type</p>

<pre><code>  PREFIX + ?
</code></pre>

<p>to get a list of all keys.</p>

<br/>

<p>To see all pane numbers, and to navigate to a pane, type</p>

<pre><code>  PREFIX + q
</code></pre>

<p>You will see a number displayed in every pane for two seconds. The active one is displayed in red. You can then type in the number to navigate to that pane.</p>

<h2>Move panes around</h2>

<p>To swap a pane with the previous/next one, type</p>

<pre><code>  PREFIX + &#123;
  PREFIX + &#125;
</code></pre>

<h2>Zooming panes</h2>

<p>Now, let&#39;s say you have two vertical panes, so they have only half of the size of your terminal. This can sometimes be problematic.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll notice that you cannot copy content from just one pane. When you cannot use the tmux copy &amp; paste, you want to be able to select content like you do in your normal terminal.</p>

<p>Or wou want to show a side by side diff with vimdiff and just need more space.</p>

<p>There is a shortcut for temporarily zooming into/out of a pane with</p>

<pre><code>  PREFIX + z
</code></pre>

<p>Try it with this one here. To unzoom, just use the same key again.</p>

<h2>Closing panes</h2>

<p>Just like for windows, there&#39;s a command to close a pane:</p>

<pre><code>  PREFIX + x
</code></pre>
