= Pane layout

Here's a way to quickly change the pane layout without manually
resizing.

tmux offers five main layouts. You can use them with any number of panes,
but to demonstrate, let's use three.

Open a new pane on the right with

    PREFIX + %

Split that new pane vertically with

    PREFIX + "

The first layout is `even-horizontal`. Type

    PREFIX + Meta-1

Your three panes should now all be side by side splitted horizontally.

Layout `even-vertical`:

    PREFIX + Meta-2

Panes should appear splitted vertically.

Layout `main-horizontal`:

    PREFIX + Meta-3

The main pane will appear on top, with more than half of the window, and
the two other panes are below splitted horizontally.

Layout `main-vertical`:

    PREFIX + Meta-4

The main pane is now on the left, and the other two panes are on the
right splitted vertically.

Layout `tiled`:

    PREFIX + Meta-5

You can also just loop trough the different layouts with

    PREFIX + Space

Try to recall the commands for navigating panes, add more panes and
play with the layouts.
